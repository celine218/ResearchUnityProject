# ResearchUnityProject
For this project we created a program where you have to follow the blue block with the red block, once the blue block is touched it will 
move to another random area within the screen. We needed to learn C# for this project, which we got alot of our information off of the
youtube channel called "Brackeys". The main two videos we refrenced our project off of were the "How to make a Video Game in Unity - MOVEMENT (E03)"
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au8oX5pu5u4&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=4) and "How to make a Video Game in Unity - PROGRAMMING (E02)"
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZEu_I-ido4&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=3). We also used the answers.unity.com, a hub
for unity users to ask and answer questions, to help with getting the collision to work.
