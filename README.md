# ResearchUnityProject
For this project, we created a program where you have to match the red blocks. When the big red block touches a tiny red block, more blocks spawn in random places. If you touch a block of a different color, the player (the big red block) dies.
We needed to learn C# for this project and get familiar with the Unity interface, which we got alot of our information off of the
youtube channel called "Brackeys". The main two videos we referenced our project off of were the "How to make a Video Game in Unity - MOVEMENT (E03)"
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au8oX5pu5u4&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=4) and "How to make a Video Game in Unity - PROGRAMMING (E02)"
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZEu_I-ido4&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=3). We also used the answers.unity.com, a hub
for unity users to ask and answer questions, to help with getting the collision to work.
